      <h1>WHAT IS BMI?</h1>
        <p>The body mass index, also known as the height-weight index, can be calculated by dividing the body mass in kilograms by the square of the body length in meters.
          It is a widely used method for calculating ideal weight. In other words, it is a kind of parameter used to understand whether a person's body weight is normal for their height.
          Thanks to this calculation method, the person can learn what his ideal weight is and can take the necessary measures to control his weight. The value obtained in terms of BMI
          (Body mass index) shows how close the person is to his or her healthy weight. However, this measurement does not indicate how much fat or muscle is in the body. It does not
          evaluate parameters such as age, gender, ethnicity. However, it has an important role in monitoring the weight status of the population, predicting possible diseases and
          evaluating risks. In order to determine such values, it is necessary to consult a dietitian and have measurements taken. Despite all this, the height and weight index has
          an important role in understanding how close a person is to his ideal weight. After the mathematical calculation, the number value in BMI can be compared with the values ​​in
          the body mass index, and information about the weight status can be obtained.How is the body mass index calculated? Before answering the question in detail, what is body mass index? must answer the question.

        <p> Body mass index can be defined as the measurement of a person's weight in proportion to their weight. In other words, it is obtained by dividing the person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.
          It is widely used for the detection of excess weight due to lubrication in children, young people and adults. Although the body mass index is mostly parallel to the body fat measurement, it does not give a clear result about the fatness rate.
          In other words, it doesn't measure body fat directly, but instead uses an equation to generate an estimate. Additional measurements should be made to measure and evaluate the amount of fat and muscle in the person's body.
          Therefore, the height-weight index is not considered a direct measure of how fat the body is. Body mass index is a tool to help determine whether a person is at a healthy or unhealthy weight.
          If the body mass index of the person is high as a result of the calculation, this may mean that there is too much fat in the person's body. In other words, a high BMI result means that the person has a high risk of developing diseases such as heart diseases, high blood pressure and diabetes.
          A very low BMI result means that the person is too thin for their height. This can also be a sign of the presence of many different diseases such as osteoporosis, weak immune system and anemia.
          Therefore, the weight-height index, which can be calculated very easily to help maintain the ideal weight, can help the person to control their weight and, more importantly, to take precautions against health risks that may develop depending on their weight.

        <h2>How to Calculate Body Mass Index?</h2>
        <p>Although calculating the body mass index does not provide clear information about body fat and muscle mass, it easily gives information about a person's ideal weight.
          The higher the value obtained in the calculation process of the height and weight index, which is an effective method for understanding whether the person is at a healthy weight, the higher the fat ratio in the person's body is understood.
          The BMI value can also be used to determine whether a person's weight poses a risk for many health problems, such as heart attack, diabetes, and cancer.
          Body mass index is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.
          The result obtained is used to understand which weight category the person is in. The weight-height index, which provides a good estimate of body fat for most people,
          It may not make sense for bodybuilders, regular exercisers and other muscular people. Even if these people are not overweight, they may encounter high BMI values ​​due to their excessive muscle mass.
          In addition, it may be insufficient to show excess body fat in elderly people who have lost a lot of muscle mass. Although the same formula is used for children and young people when calculating the height and weight index, the result obtained in BMI is interpreted differently.
          Body mass index calculation for adults, teenagers and children is done as follows:
        </p>

        <p>As in all age groups, first of all, the person's height and weight should be measured correctly. Then, the body weight (kg) / height (m) squared formula is used to calculate the height weight index. 1.74 m of the person. length and 70 kg. In an example case where it has weight, the calculation is done as follows:</p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>1.74 x 1.74 = 3.02</h2>

        <h2>70 / 3.02 = 23.2</h2>

        <p><i>In this case, the person's body mass index is 23.2 BMI.</i></p>
        <br></br>
        <b>In another example, the person is 1.55 m. tall and 95 kg. Assuming he weighs in, the BMI value is calculated as follows:</b>

        <h2>1.55 x 1.55 = 2.4025</h2>

        <h2>90 / 2.4025 = 37.4</h2>

        <i>In this case, the person's body mass index is 37.4 BMI.</i>
        
        <p>Although the calculation method of height weight index for 2 to 18 years old and child height weight index is done in the same way, the results are evaluated differently.
          Even if two children have exactly the same BMI, it can be seen that one is obese and the other is at ideal weight.
          In other words, since height and weight index in this age group differs according to age and gender, it is recommended that the measurement be made by a specialist dietitian or pediatrician.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>What Does the Body Mass Index Value Mean?</h2>
        <br></br>
        <p>After calculating the body mass index, the value obtained in BMI is interpreted as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>0 ila 18,4 BMI:</b> Weak. In case of encountering this value, which indicates that the person's weight is insufficient compared to their height, it is recommended that the person gain weight in a healthy way in the presence of a dietitian.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>18.5 ila 24.9 BMI:</b> Normal. This range of values ​​indicates that the person is at the ideal weight. It is recommended that people with this value continue to eat a regular, balanced and healthy diet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>25 ila 29.9 BMI:</b> Overweight. In this value range, which indicates that the person is overweight compared to his height, it is recommended that the person lose their excess weight with a suitable diet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>30 ila 34.9 BMI:</b> Fat. In the range of values ​​evaluated in the first degree obese category, it is understood that the person's weight is at a level that may pose a risk in terms of health. It is recommended that these people lose weight with the help of a dietitian.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>35 ila 44.9 BMI:</b> Fat. People with these values, which are defined as second degree obese, have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is recommended that the person consult a dietitian to lose weight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>45+ BMI:</b> Obese. These people who are in the third degree obese category have a very high risk of developing the disease. It is recommended to lose weight under the guidance of a physician and dietitian.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        <h3>According to the age range, the ideal body mass index of the person is as follows:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>19-24 Age:</b> 19-24 BMI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>25-34 Age:</b> 20-25 BMI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>35-44 Age:</b> 21-26 BMI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>45-54 Age:</b> 22-27 BMI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>55-64 Age:</b> 23-28 BMI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>65 Years and older:</b> 24-29 BMI.
          </li>
        </ul>
